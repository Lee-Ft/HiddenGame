# HiddenGame

The repo is a simple multiplayer game based on UE4.25. 
In this game, I implement 
  - Multiplayer Networking
  - A black hole that can attract anything near it
  - Jumping Board
  - AI Guards that have sensing and moving ability.
  - Players need to make noise by weapons to attract gurads' attention, pick up target and move to the extract zone.
